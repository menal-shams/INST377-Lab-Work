        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
        
    <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em>in a line of text.</p>
        
    <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
        
    <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both</strong></em>.</p>

        <h3>Empty Elements</h3>
        
       <p>
        Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br/>Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
        Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.
        </p>
